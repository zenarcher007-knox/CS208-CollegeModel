#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Write a series of Python classes to model students, professors, course, classes, and majors.
# Implement as many of the magic methods as make sense for your model. Submit a git repo with a readme describing how to use your classes.
# I will leave the specifics up to you but you should implement things like add/drop class, get_advisor/advisee, 
# course requirements, major requirements.
# Note that a class is a specific term offering of a course which is a more general description.
# Because it is so open ended, I am offering up to 20% extra credit (this is your golden parachute for those of you who 
# have been less than studious). The standard for 10% extra credit would be a barebones model with a readme ~100-150 lines of code.
#  20% would include a full demo and documentation ~500+ lines of code.
